<hr/>
A JavaScript library that allows for easy, and customizable typewriter effects.

# Usage
Typewriter.js is a simple library, works on zero customization, but is also very customizable.

To begin, a basic scenario:
```html
<div id="typewriter"></div>
```
This is the element that we want our typewriter effect to happen in.


You need to pair this with the following JavaScript:
```javascript
var elem = document.getElementById('typewriter');
Typewriter(elem).start();
```
This is the most basic case for Typewriter.js
